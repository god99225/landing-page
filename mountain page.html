      <h2>The Three Apostles with Ice...</h2>
      <p>
        Ice is not your typical Sawatch Range mountain. 
        Don’t expect gentle slopes and broad ridges leading 
        to a large summit plateau, consistent with nearby,
         Mount Huron or Mount Hope. Expect tedious bouldering,
          difficult route finding, and steep class 4 climbing, 
          similar to Pyramid Peak or the Maroon Bells. I would
           venture to say that Ice Mountain has about 20-ft of
            climbing that either the Maroon Bells or Pyramid
             cannot match via their standard routes.

That being said, Colonalpyat and I both agree that Ice Mountain
 was not as difficult as advertised. Due to the excess of varying 
 trip reports, Ice initially made me apprehensive. Don’t get me 
 wrong, at one point during the crux of the climb I found myself 
 in a precarious position that didn’t feel very comfortable. But,
  overall the technical difficulties with proper route finding do 
  not exceed dangerous, exposed class 3.

Because of the route finding difficulties in the upper gully,
 most get involved with exposed, committing class 4 climbing on 
 dangerous rock. Finding the proper route will be the key to a 
 fulfilling and safe day on Ice Mountain. I forgot to mention that
  the Three Apostles Massif has a reputation for a confusing approach 
  as well as an abundance of poor climbing weather. My route description 
  will address the approach in detail but I can’t do much for the bad 
  weather, you will just have to do a 4:00 a.m. start.
